Overview
--------
This repo contains a set of shell scripts put together to hotdog machines of fellow colleagues
who always seem to forget to lock their machines when they are away from the keyboard.

Hotdogging is a term we use to refer to annoying innocent hacks we do to colleagues' computers whenever they
leave them unattended and unlocked.

Hotdogging is not supposed to harm people's machines!!!!!!!!

Enjoy!
